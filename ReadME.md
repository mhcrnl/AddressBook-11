Introduction:

As a competent programmer, your understanding of control structures, your ability to design and develop algorithms, and your proficient use of data structures will help you design and develop applications to meet customer requirements. The following project will help you apply these skills in a familiar, real-world scenario.

Scenario:

You have been assigned by a national online university to create a graduation planner for its undergraduate students. The university operates with six-month terms and charges a flat tuition rate of $2,890 per term. Undergraduate students must enroll for a minimum of 12 competency units (CUs) per term. They have asked that the graduation planner meet the following minimum requirements:

Inputs

1.  Number of CUs for each individual course remaining in the degree program
2.  Planned number of units to complete per term

Outputs

1.  Accurate number of terms to completion based on input data (rounded up to the nearest terms)
2.  Accurate tuition cost based on number of terms to completion
3.  Accurate number of months to completion based on input data

Project Requirements:

Note: Submit all .java and .class files in one zipped folder.

A.  Create a graduation planner program that meets the university’s minimum requirements.
1.  Include the following design requirements:
• array, ArrayList, or map
• assignment operator
• data types
• math operators (e.g., modulus)
• printf, println, or print
• variables
2.  Include at least one of the following programming structures:
• “if” statement(s)
• logical operators
• “while” loop
3.  Include input validation to check for negative values, prompting users to re-enter values if negative.
4.  Display the results to the user in a readable and descriptive format (e.g., System.out).

B.  When you use sources, include all in-text citations and references in APA format.

Note: For definitions of terms commonly used in the rubric, see the Rubric Terms web link included in the Evaluation Procedures section.

Note: When using sources to support ideas and elements in a paper or project, the submission MUST include APA formatted in-text citations with 
a corresponding reference list for any direct quotes or paraphrasing. It is not necessary to list sources that were consulted if they have not 
been quoted or paraphrased in the text of the paper or project.

Note: No more than a combined total of 30% of a submission can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from outside sources, even if cited correctly. 
For tips on using APA style, please refer to the APA Handout web link included in the APA Guidelines section.
